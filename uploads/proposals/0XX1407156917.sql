 (6,'Bhagavad Gita As It Is \"English\" edition',3,'GITA','Bhagavad-gita is universally renowned as the jewel of Indiaâ€™s spiritual wisdom. Spoken by Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to His intimate devotee Arjuna, the Gita\'s seven hundred concise verses provide a definitive guide to the science of self-realization. Indeed no work even compares in its revelations of man\'s essential nature, his environment and ultimately his relationship with God.\r\n\r\nHis Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (right), the worldâ€™s foremost vedic scholar and teacher, represents an unbroken chain of fully self-realized spiritual masters beginning with Lord Krishna Himself. Thus, unlike other editions of the Bhagavad-gita, Srila Prabhupada conveys Lord Krishna\'s profound message \"As it is\" - without the slightest taint of adulteration or personally motivated change. Replete with sixteen full-color plates(pages), this new edition is certain to stimulate and enlighten any reader with its ancient yet thoroughly timely teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry David Thoreau: \"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmological philosophy of the Bhagavad-gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRalph Waldo Emerson: \"I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-gita. It was the first of books; it was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert Einstein: When I read the Bhagavad-gita, the only question left is how God created the universe. Everything else seems to be superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMahatma Gandhi: \"When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and I see not one ray of hope on the horizon, I turn to Bhagavad-gita and find a verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming sorrow. Those who meditate on the Gita will derive fresh joy and new meanings from it every day.\"',190,20,'uploads/items/6XX1405923740.jpg',1405875033,'1',1406312735,'265',70),

 (35,'Srimad Bhagavatam - Complete 18 Volumes Set',6,'SB','Srimad-Bhagavatam\r\nSrimad-Bhagavatam, an epic philosophical and literary classic, holds a prominent position in Indiaâ€™s voluminous written wisdom. The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the vedas, ancient sanskrit texts that touch upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally preserved through oral tradition, the vedas were first put into writing by Vyasadeva, \"the literary incarnation of God.\" After compiling the Vedas, Vyasadeva was inspired by his spiritual master to present their profound essence in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Known as \"the ripened fruit of the tree of vedic literature,â€ Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative exposition of vedic Knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter writing the Bhagavatam, Vyasadeva taught it to his son, Sukadeva Goswami, who later spoke the Bhagavatam to Maharaja Pariksit in an assembly of sages on the banks of the sacred Ganges river. Although Maharaja Pariksit was a great rajarsi (saintly king) and the Emperor of the World, when he learned that he would die in seven days, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the banks of the Ganges to seek spiritual enlightenment.\r\nThe questions of King ParÃ¯ksit and Sukadeva Goswami\'s illuminating answers, concerning everything from the nature of the self to the origin of the universe, are the basis of Srimad-Bhagavatam.\r\nThis edition of Bhagavatam is the only complete english translation with an elaborate and scholarly commentary, and it is the first edition widely available to the english-reading public. This work is the product of the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the worldâ€™s most distinguished teacher of Indian religious and philosophical thought. His sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with vedic culture combine to reveal to the West a magnificent exposition of this important classic. \r\nWith its comprehensive system of providing the original sanskrit text, roman transliteration, precise word-for-word equivalents, a lucid english translation and a comprehensive commentary, it will appeal to scholars, students and laymen alike. The entire multi volume text, presented by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, promises to occupy a significant place in the intellectual, cultural and spiritual life of modern man for a long time to come. \r\nReviews on Srimad-Bhagavatam\r\n\"This is a work to be treasured. No one of whatever faith or philosophical persuasion who reads these books with an open mind can fail to be both moved and impressed....\" \r\nDr. Garry Gelade\r\nProfessor of Psychology\r\nOxford University\r\n\"It has been my great pleasure recently to have read the Srimad-Bhagavatam in the superb edition authorized by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada....I am sure this monumental work will go far to bring the sublime message of the Bhagavatam to numerous Westerners who otherwise would miss this opportunity. \"\r\nDr. Alex Wayman\r\nProfessor of Sanskrit, Columbia University\r\n\"The Srimad-Bhagavatam is extremely useful for all those interested in ancient India, whether their interest be that of the philosopher, the student of religion, the historian, the linguist, the sociologist or the political scientist....I truly hope that Srila Prabhupada will complete his translation of the entire Bhagavatam and continue to translate other eminent Sanskrit works as well. Undoubtedly, this work of Swamiji\'s is a great contribution to the troubled human society of today\'s world.\" \r\nDr. Sooda L. Bhatt\r\nProfessor of Indian Languages, Boston University\r\n\"The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust editions of famous religious classics of India, with new translations and commentaries, are an important addition to our expanding knowledge of spiritual India. The new edition of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is particularly welcome.\" \r\nDr. John L. Mish \r\nChief, Oriental Division, New York Public Library\r\n\"In the diversity of religious approaches offered by the yogis of India, the most significant, of course, is the way of Krishna consciousness. It is amazing to see how Sri Bhaktivedanta Swami has in less than ten years succeeded, by his personal devotion, untiring energy and efficient direction, in organizing the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Now, he has undertaken the stupendous project of rendering the entire Bhagavata, the great devotional classic of India, into English. His edition is learning blended with devotional feeling and inspired by a definite purpose of communicating the intense Iyrical and devotional quality of the Bhagavata. Srila Prabhupada has done an excellent service by his able rendition of \'the abode of divine joy\' that the Bhagavata is.\"\r\nDr. Mahesh Mehta, Professor of Asian Studies\r\nUniversity of Windsor, Ontario, Canada\r\n\"It is axiomatic that no book can be expected entirely to satisfy all its potential readers. Here is one, however, which can be said to come remarkably close to that ideal....we have here the ideal of what an edition of a Sanskrit text for a Western audience should be.\" \r\nDr. R. E. Asher\r\nProfessor of Linguistics, University of Edinburgh\r\n\"...For those who have no access to the Sanskrit language, these books convey, in superb manner, the message of the Bhagavatam. In addition to being a scholarly work, it directly reflects the spiritual aspirations of a religious community which has gained considerable popularity in modern America.\" \r\nDr. Alaka Hejib\r\nDepartment of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, Harvard University\r\n\"Srimad-Bhagavatam is a valuable source material and cannot but be attractive to serious students and scholars of religion and philosophy. I recommend this series, to anyone, as an important and useful reference work.\" \r\nDr. C. P.

The main place of these pastimes is Sri Vrindavana Dhama, an area of about 168 square miles or 438 square kilometers in north-central India.

 (69,'Sri Prema Bhakti Chandrika',23,'','Sri Prema Bhakti Candrika is perhaps the most important of all of Srila Narottama dasa Thakuraâ€™s work during his manifest pastimes on earth a little over four hundred years ago. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura wrote many songs that were full of instructions. The most popular among his works, are Prarthana and Sri Prema bhakti-candrika.\r\n\r\nPrema bhakti-candrika is popularly known as Sri Rupanuga-gita as it contains the essence of all the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Prema bhakti-candrika literarily means, the rays of the moonlight of loving devotional service to Lord Krishna. These rays of the moonlight of loving devotion are so soothing that they cool down the effects of the burning fire of material existence, and they enable the conditioned soul to drink the nectar of loving devotional service to Radha and Krishna.\r\n\r\nWhile relishing love of Krishna Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu revealed to the world the essence of Krishna-bhakti. He gave to the world what was never given beforeâ€”love of Krishna, as practiced by the inhabitants of Vrindavana. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed the six Gosvamis headed by Srila Rupa and Srila Sanatana to write volumes of devotional scriptures about the nature of love of Krishna.\r\n\r\nThe Gosvamis carried out the instructions of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu by writing volumes of devotional scriptures such as: Sri Brhad Bhagavatamrta, Bhakti Rasamrta-sindhu, Ujjvalla Nilamani, Hari Bhakti Vilasa, Lalita Madhava, Vidagdha Madhava, the Sandharbas and others. Srila Krishna dasa Kaviraja Goswami then took the essence from these writings, and presented it to the world in the form of Si Caitanya Caritamrta.\r\n\r\nSrila Narottama dasa Thakura was a disciple of Lokanatha Gosvami, a principal follower of Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu ordered Lokanatha Gosvami to go to Vrindavana and excavate lost places of Krishnaâ€™s pastimes. He then foretold the appearance of Narottama dasa to Lokanatha Gosvami, saying, Lokanatha Goswami would in the future have a disciple who will manifest a unique style of devotional chantings (kirtan) that will captivate all human beings.\r\n\r\nAs an empowered master who teaches according to time, place and circumstance,Srila Narottama dasa Thakura composed Prema Bhakti-candrika in a simple style Bengali language. Though this renditions of Sri Caitanyaâ€™s teachings appeared simple, the purport is deep. The teachings of Lord Caitanya has thus been given in gist in the form of Sri Prema Bhakti Candrika. The Gosvamiâ€™s books that were difficult to undersatnd by the common masses were thus made easily understandable by the teachings of Srila Narottama dasa Thakura in his bookâ€”Sri Prema Bhakti-candrika.\r\n\r\nPrema Bhakti Candrika was considered by Srila Gaura Kishore dasa Babaji Maharaja as the only book needed for developing love of Krishna. All the teachings of Lord Caitanya are given in this gem of a book. Daily reading of this book assures one of perfection in Krishna consciousness.

 (70,'Amrita Vani',23,'','Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura (1874-1937) was the son of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, appearing in answer to his fathers prayer as the Thakura worked tirelessly to reform Gaudiya Vaisnavism and to prove its preeminence among world religions.\r\n\r\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura took up his fathers mission and both preached the conclusive truths of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhus teachings and tasted the sweetness of pure devotion himself. During his lifetime, he initiated thousands of disciples and gave thousands of hours of careful and compassionate instructions.\r\n\r\nÅšrÄ«la SarasvatÄ« PrabhupÄda was famously known as the siá¹ha, or lion guru, because he was fearless and uncompromising in his preaching. He saw the world as if it were on fire. He did not waste time trying to rescue the bodies of the conditioned souls from the immediacy of their suffering. Rather, he bypassed the deceit and hypocrisy rampant in his age (as well as ours) and tried only to retrieve by spiritual means their souls, which he saw as engulfed in the flames of material existence.Conditioned living beings are often obstinate in their refusal to hear ÅšrÄ« Caitanyaâ€™s divine message, thinking themselves comfortable enough in material existence, and ÅšrÄ«la SarasvatÄ« often used strong language to shake them from their illusion. He would remind them that â€œa sÄdhu who flatters is an enemy. A sÄdhu has to be a like a butcher â€“ ready with one stroke to slash the neck of the goat of material desire with his strong words.â€ Many were afraid to hear him speak lest the true value of their material pursuits be revealed! He was a â€œliving encyclopediaâ€ due to his vast knowledge of the scriptures and his ability to perceive the Vedic conclusion. He dispelled the doubts of the thousands who flocked to him for advice.\r\n\r\nAmrta Vani is a compendium of instructions of Srila Sarasvati Thakura. Much like the Bhaktivinoda Vani Vaibhava volumes that have preceded it, Amrta Vani is presented in a question-and-answer format. It was compiled by Sri Bhakti Mayukha Bhagavata Maharaja, one of Sarasvati Thakuras disciples. Following the system designed by the compiler of Bhaktivinoda Vani Vaibhava, Bhagavata Maharaja posed questions, then found the responses amid Sarasvati Thakuras lectures, lectures, essays, and other writings. The Caitanya-caritÃ¤mrta states, \"Krsna is so merciful that simply by aiming His instructions at Arjuna, He has given protection to the whole world.\" When those same instructions come through Krsnas pure devotee, one cannot measure the benefit. It is said that by associating for even a moment with a pure devotee one can attain all success in spiritual life.

 (71,'Sri Krishna Vijaya',23,'','The Lord mercifully incarnated in this material world and performed innumerable pastimes for the benefit of suffering conditioned souls.  Hearing of such pastimes of the Lord produced the medicine of curing the material disease, which is forgetfulness of God. Sri Krishna Vijaya is one of such transcendental literatures that described the pastimes of Lord Krishna when He appeared on this earth more than five thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n A person seeing this book for the first time may raise an objection as to the necessity of publishing another book on Sri Krishna lila, when there are already innumerable books in the market. However, these types of objections are due to the nature of the age of kali as people are mostly lazy about spiritual subjects, thus a new book depicting the pastimes of the Lord are always seeing as a burden. But those who are really interested in their self-interest are full of enthusiasm in receiving a new literature depicting the pastimes of the Lord. Even though the new book may contain a repetition of previously published materials, but there are always new angle of the presentation of the author which always provide a new revelation of the Absolute Truth.  Topics describing the pastimes of the Lord are always dynamic and not stagnant. The Lordâ€™s body is ever new, similarly topics describing His pastimes are ever new.\r\n\r\nSri Krishna Vijaya is an authentic Vaisnava literature depicting the pastimes of the Supreme Lord Krishna. This book was first published in the modern times by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, more than 150 years ago and was then republished by his son, the great Vaisnava master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. It has been noted there are other few editions of Sri Krishna Vijaya, however this new edition follows the presentation given by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura.\r\n\r\n Sri Krishna Vijaya is such a special literature as it was dear to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who expressed His appreciation of the book as follows:\r\n\r\n Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, \"Gunaraja Khan of Kulina-grama compiled a book named Sri Krsna-vijaya, in which there is a sentence revealing the author\'s ecstatic love of Krsna.\" â€˜Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja, is my life and soul.\' By this statement I am sold into the hands of the descendants of Gunaraja Khan. â€œ\r\n\r\n By these statement, the authenticity, greatness, and honorableness of this book is proven. It is needless to say how much respect this book will attract from the GauÃ²iya Vaisnavas for having received such lavish praise by none other than Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\r\n\r\n Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada commented as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œSri Krsna-vijaya is a book of poems considered to be the first poetry book written in Bengal. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura states that this book was begun in the year 1473. After seven years, it was completed. This book was originally written in plain Bengali language, and even half-educated Bengalis and women could read it very clearly. Even ordinary men with little knowledge of the alphabet could read this book and understand it. Its language is not very ornamental, and sometimes the poetry is not very sweet to hear. Although according to the sonnet style each line should contain fourteen syllables, there are sometimes sixteen, twelve or thirteen syllables in his verse. Many words used in those days could be understood only by local inhabitants, yet this book is still so popular that no bookstore is complete without it. It is very valuable for those who are interested in advancing in Krsna consciousness.\"\r\n\r\n Sri Gunaraja Khan was one of the topmost Vaisnavas, and he translated the Tenth and Eleventh Cantos of Srimad-Bhagavatam for the understanding of the common people. The book Sri Krsna-vijaya was highly praised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and it is very valuable for all Vaisnavas.\r\n\r\n Sri Maladhara Vasu or Gunaraja Khan was a great devotee of the Lord who desired greatly to benefit the world with his rendition of the accounts of the pastimes of the Lord. Thus throughout the book is found the blessings he bestowed on the readers of this book. While narrating the Lordâ€™s pastimes, he inserted his own teachings of the Absolute Truth that separates reality from illusion. The reader will thus enjoy the benefit of hearing the accounts of the pastimes of the Lord and the same time hears the philosophy of the Absolute Truth.\r\n\r\nSri Krishna Vijaya mainly deals with subjects matters described in the tenth and eleventh cantos of Srimad Bhagavatam.  The author has also included in the book some accounts from scriptures like Mahabharata, Harivamsa, Brahma vaivarta Purana and Bhavisya Purana.',175,2,'uploads/items/71XX1406308411.jpg',1406308411,'1',1406308460,'250',50),

 (76,'Patramrita: Nectar From the Letters',23,'','Patramrta is collections of instructions that were taken from the letters written by His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarsavati Thakura Prabhupada to his disciples. The letters, (about 150 of them), were dated between 1916-1936.\r\n\r\nÅšrÄ«la BhaktisiddhÄnta SarasvatÄ« GosvÄmÄ« á¹¬hÄkura wrote extensive commentaries, articles, and verses on the Vedic scriptures, and gave uncompromising lectures and wrote letters to his disciples and followers, which are enriched with the essential teachings of the Vedas. The essential instructions from his letters are now being published as a book.\r\n\r\n From a prayer by one of the principal devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we find the following:\r\n\r\n â€œO ocean of mercy, ÅšrÄ« Caitanya MahÄprabhu! Let there be an awakening of Your auspicious mercy, which easily drives away all kinds of material lamentation by making everything pure and blissful. Indeed, Your mercy awakens transcendental bliss and covers all material pleasures. By Your auspicious mercy, quarrels and disagreements arising among different scriptures are vanquished. Your auspicious mercy pours forth transcendental mellows and thus causes the heart to jubilate. Your mercy, which is full of joy, always stimulates devotional service and glorifies conjugal love of God. May transcendental bliss be awakened within my heart by Your causeless mercy.â€\r\n\r\n ÅšrÄ«mÄn MahÄprabhu is an ocean of mercy. Although He did not give any instructions for material advancement, there is no comparison to His mercy. By His compassion, all oneâ€™s material miseries can be completely vanquished so that one can feel transcendental happiness. All scriptural debate and apparent contradictions are neutralized by His grace. His mercy makes the heart intoxicated by showering upon it transcendental mellows. Its effect in the form of loving devotional service merges one in peacefulness and a flood of love of God. His mercy brings absolute purity to the heart and the most exalted form of sweetness. His compassion never creates inauspiciousness, and as such there is nothing greater than or equal to it.\r\n\r\n In order to give the people of the entire world an opportunity to have access to this great compassion of the Lord, ÅšrÄ«la BhaktisiddhÄnta SarasvatÄ« GosvÄmÄ« á¹¬hÄkura established monasteries in different cities in India and abroad and thus opened the gate of eternal auspiciousness. This was accompanied by his composing and publishing many Vaiá¹£á¹‡ava literature, and publishing the works of previous mahÄjanas or great masters with his own commentaries. Following in the footsteps of his illustrious father and spiritual master, ÅšrÄ«la Bhaktivinoda á¹¬hÄkura, he established daily, weekly, fortnightly, and monthly transcendental newspapers and magazines in various languages.\r\n\r\nHis teachings were further presented in the collection of letters written by him to his disciples and admirers, which we have now presented in the form of this book, Patramrta, or Nectars from the Letters.\r\n\r\n The original book is in Bengali and was entitled PrabhupÄdera PatrÄvali, or letters of Srila PrabhupÄda BhaktisiddhÄnta. Our original intention was to translate and publish these letters in their entirely. However, the original compiler and publisher had omitted all the names of the persons to whom the letters were addressed. Thus we found it unnecessary to publish the entirety in our English edition, but decided instead  to extract that which was most interesting, his teachings; thus the title:â€ Patramrta â€œThe Nectar from the Letters.â€ What is nectarean is that which awards us spiritual bliss and guides us on the path toward eternal life. The contents of these letters which are full of illuminations will prove highly beneficial to the readers.\r\n\r\nPaperback. 150 pages.

 (77,'Prarthana by Srila Narottam Dasa Thakura',23,'','Srila Narottama dasa Thakura spent his days and nights relishing the pastimes of Radha and Krishna amongst the devotees. Prarthana and Prema-bhakti-candrika, the two most prominent works of Narottama dasa Thakura, are in reality the outpourings of a pure heart crying in separation from Gauranga Mahaprabhu and Radha-Govinda. The bhajanas in these books are full of humility, eagerness, and anxiety for devotional perfection. Singing these songs causes the mind to reflect the mood of pure devotion, and the heart to feel intense separation from Radha and Krishna.\r\n\r\nPrarthana by Srila Narottama dasa Thakura contains many Bengali bhajanas glorifying Sri Guru, Gauranga Mahaprabhu, and Radha-Govinda. His songs are rich blends of sweet music and profound poetry. They represent the pure spiritual emotions of an aspiring devotee, and the ecstasy-filled loving feelings of a perfect saint.\r\n\r\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura used to tell his disciples that to attain the perfection of life they must know, practice and realize the teachings contained within three books: Prarthana, Prema-bhakti-candrika, and Upadesamrta. With its transliterated Bengali and accurate translations, this present English edition of Prarthana is a most pleasing addition to the ever-expanding ocean of nectar now available to sincere souls seeking the essence of spiritual life.\r\n\r\n145 pages, Hardbound with a cover flap.\r\nISBN 8187897-00-7.',325,3,'uploads/items/77XX1406309703.png',1406309703,'1',NULL,'450',60),
 (78,'Prema Vilasa',23,'','Prema Vilasa, is one of the several histories that were written by Gaudiya Vaisnavas just after Sri Caitanya MahÃ¤prabhus disappearance. In Prema Vilasa, Nityananda Dasa, a disciple of Jahnava-mata, described the lives of such great persons as Srinivasa Acarya, Narottama dasa Thakura, and Syamananda Prabhu. He also provided a glimpse into the training such Vaisnavas received at the hands of the Vrndavana Gosvamis, including Sri Jiva Gosvami, and the early efforts these Gosvamis made to popularize Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhus mission. Therefore we read of Srinivasa, Narottama, and Syamananda carrying copies of Rupa and Sanatanas bhakti literature to Bengal and the events that followed; of Narottama dasa Thakura establishing an annual Gaura-Purnima festival at Kheturi, inviting all the Gaudiya bhaktas; of the conversion of kings, dacoits, skeptical brahmanas, and common villagers to the Vaisnava understanding; and especially of the deep spiritual emotions and the undying compassion the great acaryas, imbued with Mahaprabhus sakti, felt and expressed. Caitanya Mahaprabhus pastimes are ever-relishable, but what makes them most relishable is His loving exchanges with His devotees and theirs with Him. Prema Vilasa is filled with such exchanges, and will therefore enlighten and enliven the reader to understand how Caitanya Mahaprabhu remains present in His mission and available to those who participate under the direction of His great devotees. Readers will find this book a very delightful and inspiring reading, especially those who are familiar with classic literature like Sri Caitanya Bhagavat and Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. Infact, this book, Prema Vilasa, is like a supplement to these two great scriptures on the account of life and teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His associates. Prema Vilasa takes the reader into more esoteric significant of the Lords devotees, especially how they conduct their loving devotional activities.\r\n\r\nContents from the book:\r\n\r\nThe Birth of Srinivasa Acarya\r\nThe Birth Ceremony of Srinivasa Acarya\r\nSrinivasa Acarya â€™s Childhood Pastimes\r\nPastimes of Srinivasa Acarya Prior to Going to Vrndavana\r\nSrinivasa Acarya Receives Initiation and Instruction from Gopala Bhatta Gosvami\r\nLokanatha Gosvami and Bhugarbha Gosvami Visit Vrndavana\r\nLord Caitanya Saves Love of God for Narottama dasa Thakura\r\nThe Birth of Narottama dasa Thakura\r\nNarottama dasa Thakura Leaves Home\r\nNarottama dasa Thakura Takes Initiation from Lokanatha Gosvami in Vrndavana\r\nSrinivasa Acarya and Narottama dasa Thakura are ordered to go to Bengal\r\nSrinivasa Acarya Recovers the Stolen Books and Converts the King\r\nSrinivasa Acarya Meets RÃ¤macandra Kaviraja and Govinda Kaviraja, and Attends Narottama dasa Thakuraâ€™s Festival at Kheturi\r\nSri JahnavÃ¤-mata Meets Narottama dasa Thakura and Then Travels to Vrndavana\r\nSri Jahnava-mata Meets the Gosvamis of Vrndavana and Then Returns to Bengal\r\nViracandra Prabhu Initiates Srinivasa Acaryaâ€™s Son; Instructions by Narottama dasa Thakura The Deliverance of Harivamsa by Gopala Bhatta Gosvami; the Deliverance of Candraya by Narottama dasa Thakura\r\nThe glories of Ramacandra Kaviraja.\r\nThe glories of Syamananda Prabhu.\r\nNarottama dasa Thakuraâ€™s Celebration of Gaura-Purnima.\r\nThe glories of Viracandra Prabhu.\r\nThe Disciples of Srinivasa Acarya, Narottama dasa Thakura, Syamananda Gosvami, and Ramacandra Kaviraja\r\nThe Deliverance of Jagai and Madhai\r\nThe Glories of Pundarika Vidyanidhi and Gadadhara Pandita\r\nThe Unique Characteristics of the Lordâ€™s Eternal Associates\r\nGlories of Advaita Acarya and Nityananda Prabhu',260,2,'uploads/items/78XX1406309895.gif',1406309895,'1',NULL,'350',50),
